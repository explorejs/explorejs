ExploreJS is a project to scale mentoring for new developers/students who are learning JavaScript.

The goal is to provide value through offering free "office hours" for anyone to come and debug their code over screenshare with intermediate and advanced developer mentors as well as be a community for shared ideas and resources.

[Coding Coach](https://codingcoach.io/) started a lot of mentoring relationships, and at a point it's hard to mentor more than a few people at a time, and since a lot of the speed bumps and hurdles to getting started are similar, this project aims to document external resources, generate code examples and resources and to ultimately help new developers go from student to professional by working together.
