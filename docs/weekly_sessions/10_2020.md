#### questions about Key in react 
- using Date.now()? <br>
would you truncate this or who cares... 
- UUID solves this problem <br>
https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid

- uniqid <br>
https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid <br>
has an 8byte option based on time of the users computer

formating question while using JSX
for instance adding mulitpe classes and logic
```jsx
<li className={`myclass bigtext ${ishidden? '' : 'hidden' }`}>
```
k here is the dumb part of the question when do you use double? {{}}

useRef()
k, so this is simular to an element ref in vanilla javascript, of course a lot easier to manipulate in react.

but my question on this is regular DOM stuff, like we were disucssing D3 and now I have the question for <canvas>? How do we keep these stuggles for DOM and virual DOM refresh seperate?

li or array - toggle className withing these
